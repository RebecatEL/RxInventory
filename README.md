# RxInventory

This is a continuing development project inspired by my job as a Pharmacy Assistant in a small-medium scaled pharmacy without having much technology to help managing the inventory of the pharmacy.

To help staffs to increase the efficiency on selecting the correct mediation during packaging, and also manage the inventory status to avoid waste, I am developing this project and hopefully it helps.

This is a NextJS project using Firebase Studio.

Development Roadmap:
- UI <- Current stage
- Database for medications' infos
- API
